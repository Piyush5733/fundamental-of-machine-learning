# Compute the regression line for the following dataset using the least squares method: X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5].

**Answer:**

To compute the regression line for the given dataset, we will use the least squares method. The equation of the regression line is given by:

**y = mx + c**

where:
*   **m** is the slope of the line
*   **c** is the y-intercept

The formulas for the slope (m) and the y-intercept (c) are:

**m = Σ((xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y))) / Σ((xi - mean(X))²)**

**c = mean(Y) - m * mean(X)**

### Step 1: Calculate the mean of X and Y

*   **X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**
*   **Y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]**

**mean(X) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3**

**mean(Y) = (2 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4**

### Step 2: Calculate the terms for the slope formula

We need to calculate `(xi - mean(X))`, `(yi - mean(Y))`, `(xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y))`, and `(xi - mean(X))²` for each data point.

| xi | yi | xi - mean(X) | yi - mean(Y) | (xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y)) | (xi - mean(X))² |
| -- | -- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1  | 2  | -2           | -2           | 4                               | 4               |
| 2  | 4  | -1           | 0            | 0                               | 1               |
| 3  | 5  | 0            | 1            | 0                               | 0               |
| 4  | 4  | 1            | 0            | 0                               | 1               |
| 5  | 5  | 2            | 1            | 2                               | 4               |
| **Σ** |    |              |              | **6**                           | **10**          |

From the table, we have:

*   **Σ((xi - mean(X)) * (yi - mean(Y))) = 6**
*   **Σ((xi - mean(X))²) = 10**

### Step 3: Calculate the slope (m)

**m = 6 / 10 = 0.6**

### Step 4: Calculate the y-intercept (c)

**c = mean(Y) - m * mean(X)**
**c = 4 - 0.6 * 3**
**c = 4 - 1.8**
**c = 2.2**

### Step 5: Write the regression line equation

Now that we have the slope (m) and the y-intercept (c), we can write the equation of the regression line:

**y = 0.6x + 2.2**

This is the regression line for the given dataset using the least squares method.
