# An airline knows that 5 percent of the people making reservations on a certain flight will not show up. Consequently, their policy is to sell 52 tickets for a flight that can hold only 50 passengers. What is the probability that there will be a seat available for every passenger who shows up?

**Answer:**

This is a binomial probability problem. We want to find the probability that the number of passengers who show up is less than or equal to the number of available seats.

### 1. Define the Parameters

*   **n** (number of trials): 52 (the number of tickets sold)
*   **p** (probability of a single "success," i.e., a passenger showing up): The probability of a passenger *not* showing up is 5% or 0.05. Therefore, the probability of a passenger showing up is `1 - 0.05 = 0.95`.
*   **q** (probability of a single "failure," i.e., a passenger not showing up): 0.05
*   **k** (number of successes): The number of passengers who show up.
*   **Capacity:** 50 seats.

### 2. Define the Event

We want to find the probability that there will be a seat available for every passenger who shows up. This means the number of passengers who show up (`k`) must be less than or equal to 50.

**P(k ≤ 50)**

### 3. Use the Binomial Probability Formula

The binomial probability formula is:

**P(X = k) = C(n, k) * pᵏ * qⁿ⁻ᵏ**

where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient, calculated as `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`.

Calculating `P(k ≤ 50)` directly would require us to calculate the probabilities for `k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 50` and add them up. A much simpler approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1.

The complementary event is that there are *not* enough seats, which happens if the number of passengers who show up is 51 or 52.

**P(not enough seats) = P(k > 50) = P(k = 51) + P(k = 52)**

The probability we want is:

**P(k ≤ 50) = 1 - P(k > 50)**

### 4. Calculate the Probabilities for the Complementary Event

**a) Calculate P(k = 51):**

*   `n = 52`, `k = 51`, `p = 0.95`, `q = 0.05`
*   `C(52, 51) = 52! / (51! * (52-51)!) = 52! / (51! * 1!) = 52`
*   `P(k = 51) = 52 * (0.95)⁵¹ * (0.05)¹`
*   `P(k = 51) ≈ 52 * 0.07295 * 0.05`
*   **P(k = 51) ≈ 0.18967**

**b) Calculate P(k = 52):**

*   `n = 52`, `k = 52`, `p = 0.95`, `q = 0.05`
*   `C(52, 52) = 52! / (52! * (52-52)!) = 52! / (52! * 0!) = 1`
*   `P(k = 52) = 1 * (0.95)⁵² * (0.05)⁰`
*   `P(k = 52) = (0.95)⁵² * 1`
*   **P(k = 52) ≈ 0.0693**

**c) Calculate P(k > 50):**

*   `P(k > 50) = P(k = 51) + P(k = 52)`
*   `P(k > 50) ≈ 0.18967 + 0.0693`
*   **P(k > 50) ≈ 0.25897**

### 5. Calculate the Final Probability

Now we can find the probability that there will be a seat for every passenger who shows up:

*   `P(k ≤ 50) = 1 - P(k > 50)`
*   `P(k ≤ 50) ≈ 1 - 0.25897`
*   **P(k ≤ 50) ≈ 0.74103**

So, the probability that there will be a seat available for every passenger who shows up is approximately **74.1%**.
