**Answer:**

## Introduction to Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is primarily used for **binary classification** problems. Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It is used to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class (e.g., 0 or 1, "yes" or "no," "spam" or "not spam").

The core idea of logistic regression is to use a **logistic function (or sigmoid function)** to model a binary dependent variable.

## The Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that takes any real-valued number and maps it to a value between 0 and 1. This makes it ideal for converting the output of a linear equation into a probability.

The formula for the sigmoid function is:

**h_θ(x) = g(z) = 1 / (1 + e⁻ᶻ)**

where `z` is the output of the linear regression model, i.e., `z = θᵀx`.

The output of the sigmoid function, `h_θ(x)`, is interpreted as the probability that the output is 1, given the input `x` and the parameters `θ`.

**P(y=1 | x; θ) = h_θ(x)**

## The Cost Function

The cost function for logistic regression measures how well the model is performing. We cannot use the same cost function as linear regression (Mean Squared Error) because the sigmoid function would cause the cost function to be non-convex, leading to multiple local minima. This would make it difficult for an optimization algorithm to find the global minimum.

Instead, we use a cost function called **Log Loss** or **Binary Cross-Entropy**. This cost function is convex and is defined as follows for a single training example:

**Cost(h_θ(x), y) = -y * log(h_θ(x)) - (1 - y) * log(1 - h_θ(x))**

This can be broken down into two cases:

*   If **y = 1**, the cost is **-log(h_θ(x))**. This cost is 0 if the predicted probability `h_θ(x)` is 1, and it approaches infinity as the predicted probability approaches 0.
*   If **y = 0**, the cost is **-log(1 - h_θ(x))**. This cost is 0 if the predicted probability `h_θ(x)` is 0, and it approaches infinity as the predicted probability approaches 1.

The overall cost function for all `m` training examples is the average of the log loss over all training examples:

**J(θ) = -(1/m) * Σ [ y⁽ⁱ⁾ * log(h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾)) + (1 - y⁽ⁱ⁾) * log(1 - h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾)) ]**

Our goal is to find the values of `θ` that minimize this cost function.

## The Optimizer: Gradient Descent

Since there is no closed-form solution for the parameters `θ` in logistic regression, we use an iterative optimization algorithm to find the values of `θ` that minimize the cost function `J(θ)`. The most common optimizer for logistic regression is **Gradient Descent**.

Gradient Descent works by repeatedly updating the parameters `θ` in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. The update rule for each parameter `θ_j` is:

**θ_j := θ_j - α * (1/m) * Σ (h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾) * x_j⁽ⁱ⁾**

where:
*   **α** is the learning rate, which controls the size of the steps we take.
*   **m** is the number of training examples.
*   **h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾** is the error for the i-th training example.
*   **x_j⁽ⁱ⁾** is the value of the j-th feature for the i-th training example.

The algorithm repeatedly performs this update for all parameters `θ_j` until it converges to the minimum of the cost function.

## Conclusion

In summary, Logistic Regression is a powerful classification algorithm that consists of three key components:

1.  **The Sigmoid Function:** To convert the output of a linear model into a probability.
2.  **The Log Loss Cost Function:** A convex cost function that measures the performance of the model.
3.  **Gradient Descent:** An optimization algorithm used to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function.

By combining these components, logistic regression can effectively learn to classify data into two categories.
