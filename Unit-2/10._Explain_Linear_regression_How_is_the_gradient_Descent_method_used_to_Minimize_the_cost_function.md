**Answer:**

## Introduction to Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (the output) and one or more independent variables (the inputs). It is one of the simplest and most widely used regression algorithms.

The goal of linear regression is to find a linear equation that best fits the data. In the case of a single input variable (simple linear regression), this equation is of the form:

**y = mx + c**

where:
*   **y** is the predicted output value.
*   **x** is the input feature.
*   **m** is the slope of the line (the weight of the feature).
*   **c** is the y-intercept (the bias term).

In a more general form with multiple features, the equation is:

**h_θ(x) = θ₀ + θ₁x₁ + θ₂x₂ + ... + θₙxₙ**

where:
*   **h_θ(x)** is the predicted output.
*   **θ₀, θ₁, ..., θₙ** are the parameters (weights) of the model.
*   **x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ** are the input features.

The model "learns" by finding the optimal values for the parameters `θ` that result in the best-fitting line for the training data.

## The Cost Function

To find the best-fitting line, we need a way to measure how well the line fits the data. This is done using a **cost function**. The cost function for linear regression is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

The MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The formula for the MSE cost function, `J(θ)`, is:

**J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ [ (h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)² ]**

where:
*   **m** is the number of training examples.
*   **h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾)** is the predicted value for the i-th training example.
*   **y⁽ⁱ⁾** is the actual value for the i-th training example.
*   The `1/2` is included for mathematical convenience to simplify the derivative later on.

The goal is to find the values of `θ` that minimize this cost function. A lower cost means that the line is a better fit for the data.

## The Optimizer: Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In the context of linear regression, we use it to find the values of the parameters `θ` that minimize the cost function `J(θ)`.

The main idea behind Gradient Descent is to start with some initial values for `θ` and then repeatedly update them in the direction that most steeply decreases the cost function. This direction is the negative of the gradient of the cost function.

### The Gradient Descent Update Rule

The update rule for each parameter `θ_j` is:

**θ_j := θ_j - α * (∂/∂θ_j) J(θ)**

where:
*   **α** is the **learning rate**, a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps we take on each iteration.
*   **(∂/∂θ_j) J(θ)** is the **partial derivative** of the cost function with respect to the parameter `θ_j`. This tells us the slope of the cost function in the direction of `θ_j`.

For linear regression, the partial derivative of the cost function is:

**(∂/∂θ_j) J(θ) = (1/m) * Σ [ (h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾) * x_j⁽ⁱ⁾ ]**

So, the complete update rule for linear regression is:

**θ_j := θ_j - α * (1/m) * Σ [ (h_θ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾) * x_j⁽ⁱ⁾ ]**

### The Iterative Process

The Gradient Descent algorithm works as follows:

1.  **Initialize Parameters:** Start with some initial values for the parameters `θ` (e.g., all zeros).
2.  **Calculate the Gradient:** Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter `θ_j`.
3.  **Update Parameters:** Update each parameter `θ_j` using the update rule.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cost function converges to a minimum (i.e., the change in the cost function between iterations is very small).

By following this process, Gradient Descent iteratively adjusts the parameters of the linear regression model to find the line that best fits the data, thereby minimizing the Mean Squared Error.
