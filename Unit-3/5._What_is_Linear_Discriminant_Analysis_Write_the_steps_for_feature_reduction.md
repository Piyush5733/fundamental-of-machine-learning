## What is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)?

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a **supervised** machine learning algorithm that is used for both **dimensionality reduction** and **classification**. As a dimensionality reduction technique, its primary goal is to project a dataset with a high number of features onto a lower-dimensional space in a way that **maximizes the separability between classes**.

Unlike PCA, which is an unsupervised algorithm that focuses on capturing the maximum variance in the data, LDA uses the class labels to find a new set of axes (linear discriminants) that best separates the data points of different classes.

## Steps for Feature Reduction using LDA

The LDA algorithm for feature reduction can be broken down into the following steps:

### Step 1: Compute the Mean Vectors for Each Class

For a dataset with `C` classes and `d` features, we first compute the `d`-dimensional mean vector for each class. The mean vector `μ_i` for class `i` contains the average value of each feature for all the samples in that class.

**μ_i = (1/n_i) * Σ x**  (for all x in class i)

where `n_i` is the number of samples in class `i`.

### Step 2: Compute the Scatter Matrices

Next, we compute two scatter matrices:

**a) Within-Class Scatter Matrix (S_W):**

This matrix represents the scatter (or variance) of the data points within each class. It is the sum of the covariance matrices for each class. A small `S_W` is desirable, as it means that the data points within each class are close to each other.

**S_W = Σ (S_i)**

where `S_i` is the scatter matrix for class `i`:

**S_i = Σ (x - μ_i)(x - μ_i)ᵀ** (for all x in class i)

**b) Between-Class Scatter Matrix (S_B):**

This matrix represents the scatter (or variance) between the means of the different classes. A large `S_B` is desirable, as it means that the means of the classes are far apart from each other.

**S_B = Σ n_i (μ_i - μ)(μ_i - μ)ᵀ**

where `μ` is the overall mean of all the data, and `n_i` is the number of samples in class `i`.

### Step 3: Compute the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

The goal of LDA is to find a projection that maximizes the ratio of the between-class scatter to the within-class scatter. This is achieved by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for the matrix `(S_W)⁻¹ * S_B`.

We compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix `(S_W)⁻¹ * S_B`.

### Step 4: Sort the Eigenvectors

The eigenvectors are sorted in descending order based on their corresponding eigenvalues. The eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue represents the direction of the best linear discriminant, as it maximizes the ratio of between-class to within-class scatter.

### Step 5: Select the Top k Eigenvectors

We select the top `k` eigenvectors to form the new feature subspace. The value of `k` is the desired number of dimensions for the new feature space, and it must be less than the original number of dimensions `d`. The number of linear discriminants `k` is at most `C-1`, where `C` is the number of classes.

These `k` eigenvectors form the **transformation matrix W**.

### Step 6: Transform the Data

The final step is to project the original `d`-dimensional data onto the new `k`-dimensional feature subspace. This is done by taking the dot product of the original data `X` and the transformation matrix `W`:

**Y = X * W**

where:
*   **X** is the original `m x d` dataset (m samples, d features).
*   **W** is the `d x k` transformation matrix.
*   **Y** is the new `m x k` dataset with reduced dimensionality.

The resulting dataset `Y` has fewer features but retains the information that is most relevant for discriminating between the classes.
