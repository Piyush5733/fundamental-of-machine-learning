# Main Steps in the Process of Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a structured statistical procedure used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The main steps involved are:

1.  **State the Hypotheses**:
    *   Formulate the **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**, which typically states there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship.
    *   Formulate the **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)**, which is the claim the researcher is trying to find evidence for (e.g., there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship).

2.  **Choose the Significance Level ($\alpha$)**:
    *   Select a pre-determined threshold (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) that represents the maximum acceptable probability of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis).

3.  **Select the Appropriate Test Statistic**:
    *   Choose the statistical test (e.g., Z-test, T-test, Chi-Square test, ANOVA) that is suitable for the type of data, the research question, and the assumptions about the population.

4.  **Collect Data and Calculate Test Statistic**:
    *   Gather relevant sample data.
    *   Compute the value of the chosen test statistic from the sample data.

5.  **Determine the P-value or Critical Value**:
    *   **P-value Approach**: Calculate the p-value, which is the probability of observing data as extreme as, or more extreme than, the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
    *   **Critical Value Approach**: Determine the critical value(s) from the appropriate statistical distribution based on the chosen significance level ($\alpha$).

6.  **Make a Decision**:
    *   **Using P-value**: If the p-value $\le \alpha$, **reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$)**.
    *   **Using Critical Value**: If the calculated test statistic falls into the rejection region (beyond the critical value), **reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$)**.
    *   Otherwise, **fail to reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$)**.

7.  **Interpret the Results**:
    *   State the conclusion in the context of the original research question, explaining what the decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis implies about the population.

These steps provide a systematic framework for drawing statistically sound conclusions from empirical data.
